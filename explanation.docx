An example response is:

Hello from ::ffff:172.25.0.1:41866
to ::ffff:172.25.0.2:8894
Hello from ::ffff:172.25.0.1:50420
to ::ffff:172.25.0.3:8893


the notation '::ffff' is subnet prefix for IPv4 addressses placed inside an IPv6 space.
the address '172.25.0.2' is docker internal host IP. and '41866' is the port number at which the service resides
Same applies to the second request.
